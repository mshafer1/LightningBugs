LightningBugs
=============

The well loved (by some) game Lightning Bugs recreated!

=============

1.	Two players â€“ human and computer
2.	Both move on clock ticks in the direction currently pointing.
3.	Both choose which direction to turn. User inputs via arrow keys and computer just turns its car (or bug)
4.	As players move, they leave a permanent trail behind.
5.	If a player runs into a wall or a trail they die and other player wins.
6.	For simplification, this is done in a 2d top down view.
